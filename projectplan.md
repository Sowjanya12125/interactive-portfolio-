This portfolio is a single, interactive space that brings together my professional journey—resume, experience, technical projects, and GitHub profile—into a clear and structured format.
It’s designed to give recruiters a streamlined view of my skills while also allowing deeper exploration through project showcases, repository access, and downloadable resources.
More than a static resume, it reflects both my technical expertise and my ability to present work in an organized, user-friendly way.
